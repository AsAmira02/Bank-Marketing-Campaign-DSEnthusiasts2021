The code is well organized. It includes all necessary parts mentioned in the task week 9.

For data transformation: 

1- Duplicate rows were checked and deleted from dataset.
2- Univariate analysis of categorical variables were done including barplots as well as numerical variables
analysis.
3- Outlier treatment : It was decided to keep the outliers in order not to lose model generalization. 
4- Finally the 'duration' feature was dropped.
